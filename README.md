# verse-note
 
a simple note made with client side module javascript.  
Firebase - Firestore(database) and Authentication used save data and user login.
Firebase provides server side architecture as API(callback function). 
This note has very essential functions - view, write, edit, delete and login.
So It's quite flexible to develop this note to other type of apps like
diary, chat, simple board, group note(multiple login possible)
One missing feature is image upload.
